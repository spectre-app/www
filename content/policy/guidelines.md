  The guidelines for engaging in the Spectre community as well as in the name of Spectre globally.
---

We invite everyone with a constructive interest in *Spectre* to participate in
its community and contribute thoughts, questions, feedback and recommendations.

## Guidelines

To ensure a healthy and inclusive environment for you, we engage to uphold the
following guidelines for the conduct of all members in the community:

We Are People
: We are the&nbsp;people of the&nbsp;world, each with&nbsp;our unique&nbsp;background
  and experience. We&nbsp;are talented in&nbsp;ways others are&nbsp;not.
  Our&nbsp;voice&nbsp;matters. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not discriminate.

Established Consent
: We stay on&nbsp;topic because the&nbsp;topic is the&nbsp;reason others
  are&nbsp;here. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not engage where there&nbsp;is no&nbsp;explicit
  prior&nbsp;consent.

Respect & Kindness
: We seek to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;others, assuming their&nbsp;intentions are&nbsp;well,
  before we&nbsp;choose how&nbsp;to&nbsp;express ourselves to&nbsp;them.

Validation & Understanding
: Our opinions and preferences are the result of our past experience — equally so for those of others.
  We pause to understand and explicitly validate other perspectives.

Patience & Grace
: As important as the&nbsp;things we&nbsp;say is the&nbsp;way in&nbsp;which
  we&nbsp;say&nbsp;them.
  We&nbsp;are skillful with our&nbsp;choice of&nbsp;language and give&nbsp;others
  the&nbsp;opportunity to prove&nbsp;themselves.

Embracing Mistakes
: We are all human, we&nbsp;all learn best through trying.
  Sometimes we&nbsp;get it&nbsp;wrong.
  We&nbsp;are&nbsp;wholly&nbsp;permitted the&nbsp;mistakes we learn&nbsp;from,
  repair, and owe&nbsp;up&nbsp;to.

You Are The Many
: You deserve the&nbsp;very&nbsp;best — you all do.
  We&nbsp;don't&nbsp;sacrifice what you&nbsp;deserve to&nbsp;benefit someone&nbsp;else,
  or sacrifice what someone&nbsp;else deserves to&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;you.

Stand Vigilant
: A space is&nbsp;only as&nbsp;safe as&nbsp;we keep&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;assume
  the&nbsp;duty of reporting transgressions we&nbsp;see,
  however&nbsp;innocent, trusting kindness on the&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;officers.

We pledge to moderate our own actions in accordance with these priorities
when engaging with members of this community, or the larger global community
in the name of or in association with Spectre.


## Enforcement

Your liberty, freedom and security does not come from our guidelines,
it comes from our actions. Keeping each other safe is the responsibility of all.  

### Reporting

Our enforcement officer should be informed of any transgressions you encounter:  
*Maarten Billemont <maarten@spectre.app>*

* Reporting someone does not condemn them.  
  Allow actions to speak for themselves and trust that officers engage with
  reports in kindness, empathy and understanding for all involved.

* Reports may be made anonymously.  
  Please include any and all legally acquired facts and information that may
  assist in a thorough evaluation.

### Evaluation

The aim is to ensure *Spectre*'s community remains free from harm.

Officers take reports seriously and seek an understanding of the situation prior
to judging it.

Any members of the *Spectre* community may be contacted by Spectre's enforcement
officer in private to seek verification of any claims.

### Privacy

Reports and enforcement conversations are held in *maximum confidentiality*.

Both the officers and all members under this pledge commit to respecting the
confidentiality of enforcement conversations to the maximum extent of the law.

This confidentiality does not dissolve upon conclusion of the investigation.

No information is shared barring prior consent by those who shared it with the
enforcement officer, not with the public or in any enforcement conversations.

### Action

Officers reserve the right to take the following actions pursuant to the
enforcement of these guidelines:

 * Issue private warnings to any community members
 * Modify community messages by any community members,
   leaving an action notice where modifications were made
 * Modify code made by any community members
 * Temporarily or permanently limit or revoke the rights
   of any community member.
