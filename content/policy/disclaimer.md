  Description of Spectre's limited liability.
---

Spectre's mission is to empower the people of the world with personal security,
liability and liberty from control by external entities.

---

That said, Spectre produces *software*, not security services, and Spectre's
products are provided as-is.  They do not come with any guarantees.

We have no oversight over, and assume no liability for the way in which you
choose to use Spectre. We do not provide any guarantees with how Spectre
operates or what the expectations are for using it.

> You assume sole responsibility over any losses you suffer in your operations,
> regardless of whether those operations involve the use of our product.

This is the same disclaimer you'll find on any software product, with the
exception that ours is written in such a way as to enable you to understand it.

If you do not agree with our limited liability, absent guarantees and disclaimer
of responsibility, we recommend you reach out to seek a custom SLA or find
yourself an alternative product that ticks your legal requirements.
