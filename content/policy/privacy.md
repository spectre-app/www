  Detailed information on how the Spectre applications handle personal
  information.

## In Short

Spectre has adopted a *zero-PII* (personally identifiable information) policy by default,
with the intent of making your sensitive personal information effectively
inaccessible to us.

### What does this mean?

Spectre apps will never:

* Transmit your name, passwords, personal or contact information.
* Transmit any information which could be used to identify you.

It is for these reasons that:

* You do not actually hold an account with us.
* We can not recover your lost credentials.
* Your payments or refunds are not handled by us.
* We do not sync passwords between devices.
* Your collaboration may be required when you report an issue.
* We are unable to provide details to authorities on your use of Spectre.

What motivates our dedication to your privacy?

- Keeping zero user records reduces our internal and legal risk profile.
- Statelessness is a core operating principle underpinning privacy control.
- We believe your trust is earned only by proving our commitments through transparency.

## Collection

With the important bit out of the way, the Spectre app does collect or transmit
some information, and users may sometimes submit personal information to us.

The following details how that collection takes place in order to ensure that our *zero-PII* policy is honoured.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-file-exclamation fa-fw"></i> Device Logs

> *Device logs are available only to you, or (anonymous critical logs) via Diagnostics if enabled by you.*

Transparency and self-empowerment are important values at Spectre. For this reason, the app collects logs on its own operation in the background for you to review.

These logs are intended to help you
keep track of what is happening, to enable you to investigate
unexpected behaviour and to ensure you are the gatekeeper when you recruit our
assistance to diagnose a problem with the app.

Logs can be viewed by you at any time. Logs are not saved to disk and disappear
as soon as the app is quit.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-id-badge fa-fw"></i> Identifiers

> *Identifiers are fully anonymized and available only to you, or via Diagnostics if enabled by you.*

The purpose of identifiers is to help diagnose information at your request.
They can only be correlated if you choose to self-identify yourself to our
support staff using your own identifiers.

Spectre is determined to limit its own ability to correlate information with individuals.
We do this by cryptographically severing the link between you and your identifiers.
As a result, it is impossible to use the identifiers for tracking or tracing.

#### User Identifier

Spectre uses an authenticated identifier passed through a one-way cryptographic
encoding algorithm to ensure that:

1. Having the identifier, it is impossible to deduce any user information from it.
2. Having information on a user, it is impossible to deduce the user's identifier from it.

#### Device Identifiers

Spectre exclusively uses random device identifiers to ensure that:

1. Having the identifier, it is impossible to determine the device that created it.
2. Knowing the device, it is impossible to determine what its identifier would be.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-car-crash fa-fw"></i> Crash Monitoring

> *Crash monitoring is fully anonymous and turned off, unless Diagnostics is enabled by you.*

It is important to us that your experience using the app is as flawless as
possible. To that end, Spectre was designed with the ability to take action should
the app crash for any reason.

When the app crashes, the software can make a best-effort attempt to write to
disk some information that will assist in determining the cause of the crash.
This information is commonly referred to as a "crash report".

When the app is started next, Spectre will find this crash report on disk and
attempt to send it to our crash monitoring service. Once there, our developers
will be notified and investigate the cause of your crash. Using this information,
Spectre's code can be improved to help prevent these crashes from occurring in the future.

#### Metrics

As part of recording a crash event, Spectre discloses the following metric categories:

* Information describing the device model (eg. device name, model, screen, memory)
* Information describing the operating system version (eg. system name, version, kernel)
* Information describing the application version (eg. application build, version, distribution)
* Information describing the state of the device (eg. time zone, orientation, carrier, locale)
* Information describing the cause of the crash (eg. binaries, libraries, call stack)
* Spectre's critical operation logs, void of any personal information
* Spectre user and device identifiers as described above

As a result of our zero-PII policy, this information cannot trace back to you.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-chart-mixed fa-fw"></i> Analytics

> *Analytics are anonymous and turned off by default, unless Diagnostics is enabled by you.*

To ensure we are adequately serving the needs of our many users, avoid creating
confusing user experiences and build our features such that they are maximally helpful to
people of all abilities, we use analytics to build statistical user interaction models.

#### Metrics

Spectre's statistical user interaction models consist of the following device information:

* Information describing the device model (eg. device name, model, screen, memory)
* Information describing the operating system version (eg. system name, version, kernel)
* Information describing the application version (eg. application build, version, distribution)
* Information describing the state of the device (eg. time zone, orientation, carrier, locale)
* Information describing application interaction (eg. controls used, timing, problems)
* Spectre user and device identifiers as described above

As a result of our zero-PII policy, this information cannot trace back to you.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-message-lines fa-fw"></i> Communication

> *Notifications are disabled unless you consent to turning them on in the app.*

To keep our users appraised of significant developments in digital security and
raise awareness of relevant important events, Spectre users can opt-in to
receiving one-way notifications in their app. If security information needs to
be communicated, such as a critical bug in the app or a widely used website has
been compromised, Spectre may use notifications to appraise and advise its
user-base.

Turning notifications off causes your device's known registration to be deleted.

#### Metrics

To facilitate participation in Spectre's notifications, Spectre discloses the
following details:

* Information describing the device model (eg. device name, model, screen, memory)
* Information describing the operating system version (eg. system name, version, kernel)
* Information describing the application version (eg. application build, version, distribution)
* Information describing the state of the device (eg. time zone, orientation, carrier, locale)

As a result of our zero-PII policy, this information cannot uniquely trace back
to you.

### <i class="fa-duotone fa-envelope-open-text fa-fw"></i> Updates

> *Update e-mails are only sent if you have registered for an update stream.*
