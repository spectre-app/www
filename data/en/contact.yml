    For a&nbsp;limited&nbsp;time only, *Spectre* is launching a&nbsp;public beta&nbsp;program.


    Beta participants will have full and unlimited access to all of *Spectre*'s capabilities,
    and are&nbsp;invited to&nbsp;contribute feedback on their&nbsp;experience.


    The algorithm is&nbsp;mature and&nbsp;already in&nbsp;use by&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;people world-wide.
    Although we&nbsp;have thoroughly&nbsp;tested the&nbsp;software, beta&nbsp;participants must be&nbsp;prepared for the&nbsp;possibility
    of encountering&nbsp;bugs during their&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the&nbsp;application.


    If you're interested, feel&nbsp;free to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;out.
