  We believe **saving passwords** in an app,    
  or **uploading** them all to the cloud,  
  is a recipe for personal disaster.
  
  Why?  
  Your privacy is your life.  
  To them, it's a risk assessment.

  The only password that can't be lost,
  stolen, seized, ransomed or left on the bus,  
  is a password that doesn't exist.

callout: |
  *Spectre* is a password&nbsp;app  
  that contains no&nbsp;passwords.  

closing: |
  *Spectre* is a password cipher:  
  Instead of saving and sending passwords across the internet,
  Spectre calculates the password you need, only when you need it,
  then throws it away again.

  Remember one secret, math does the rest.
  
  We **delete** our passwords.
