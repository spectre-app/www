      Open any *Spectre* app, anywhere. Zero setup required.  
      Sign in with your name and personal secret.

      <sub>Personal secret pro-tip: consider using an absurd word combination.  
      `wild berry yelling`, `freshly exhasperated kitten`. You try one.</sub>

    body: |
      Type a domain name.  
      *Spectre* already has your password ready, on the spot.

      <sub>Your site's password derives from your&nbsp;sign-in.  
      Think of a calculator; `you + site = password`, like `1 + 1 = 2`, every time.</sub>

      <sub>Share your site passwords with friends, if you like.  
      _Under no circumstances_ tell anyone else your personal secret.</sub>
