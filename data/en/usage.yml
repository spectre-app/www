      Open the *Spectre* app. Your own, your friend's &ndash; any app, anywhere.  
      Enter your full name and your personal *Spectre* secret to sign in.

      <sub>Pro-tip for choosing your *Spectre* secret: absurd word&nbsp;combinations!

    body: |
      Use only the site's domain name, drop the rest:

      <sub>Your site password comes directly from your&nbsp;sign-in&nbsp;information in step [`1`].

      From now on, just log&nbsp;in with your site's *Spectre*&nbsp;password.

      <sub>Share your site passwords with friends, if you like.  
      _Under no circumstances_ tell anyone else your&nbsp;personal&nbsp;Spectre&nbsp;secret.</sub>
