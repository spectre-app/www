      Open the *Spectre* app, anywhere.  
      Sign in with your full name and your personal *Spectre* secret.

      <sub>Pro-tip for choosing a *Spectre* secret: absurd word&nbsp;combinations are great.  
      `wild berry yelling`, `freshly exhasperated kitten`. You&nbsp;try&nbsp;one.</sub>

    partial: "usage-site.html"
    body: |
      Use only the site's domain name, drop the rest:

      <sub>Your site password comes directly from your&nbsp;sign-in&nbsp;information in step [`1`].

      From now on, just log&nbsp;in with your site's *Spectre*&nbsp;password.

      <sub>Share your site passwords with friends, if you like.  
      _Under no circumstances_ tell anyone else your&nbsp;personal&nbsp;secret.</sub>
