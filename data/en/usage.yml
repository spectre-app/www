      Sign&nbsp;into any *Spectre*&nbsp;app from anywhere to access your&nbsp;passwords immediately.


      No&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;connection required: *Spectre*&nbsp;does not upload or download your&nbsp;passwords from the&nbsp;cloud.

      Tell&nbsp;*Spectre* who you need a&nbsp;password for and it's&nbsp;there, on&nbsp;the&nbsp;spot.


      *Spectre*&nbsp;cryptographically computes your&nbsp;site's&nbsp;passwords from your&nbsp;sign-in&nbsp;identity.
      It&nbsp;works from any device, even that of a&nbsp;friend, or a&nbsp;brand&nbsp;new&nbsp;phone.
