      More than ever, online&nbsp;liberty requires breaking&nbsp;dependency on unreliable&nbsp;actors
      or&nbsp;corporate and state entities.


      Your identity is safe only when its sole&nbsp;gatekeeper is you
      and it cannot be held&nbsp;hostage in a cloud&nbsp;account or behind a&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;wall.

      Sustainable security has no loopholes or caveats.
      It&nbsp;doesn't come with terms&nbsp;on&nbsp;use, require&nbsp;backups, or expect blind&nbsp;trust.


      *Spectre* achieves stateless identity management, vastly reducing the attack&nbsp;surface,
      making you immune to&nbsp;loss, confiscation, decryption and&nbsp;leaks.
