  *Spectre* is a password&nbsp;app  
  that has no&nbsp;passwords.

  Tried keeping countless passwords safe  
  in an app, keychain, cloud, vault, backup, or&nbsp;browser?  
  
  <i class="fas fa-fw fa-face-laugh-beam" title="Haha"></i>  
  We did too.  
  
  *Spectre* holds no passwords at all.  
  When it's time to log in,  
  it just calculates your site's password for you.
  
  Cryptographic passwords are never unavailable,  
  lost, ransomed, confiscated or stolen.
  
  Is that even possible?  
  It is now.
