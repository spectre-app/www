### CALLOUT
enable: true
name: Introduction

callout: |
  Your entire online access,  
  gated behind a wall of passwords,  
  owned and controlled by cloud operators  
  or trapped in an app.

  Disaster is just *that* day away.  
  Delete your passwords.

  *Spectre* is a completely novel approach to digital access control.
  
  Rather than trying to keep hundreds of passwords safe and available in an app,  
  *Spectre* holds no passwords at all.  
  
  When it's time to log in, *Spectre* calculates your site's password for you onâ€‘demand,
  storing it nowhere, ensuring it can never be lost or stolen.
  
  Is that even possible?  
  It is now.
