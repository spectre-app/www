  At *Spectre*,  
  we believe saving passwords in an app,    
  or uploading them to the cloud,  
  is a recipe for disaster.
  
  Why?  
  Your privacy is your life.  
  To them, it's a risk assessment.

  *Spectre* is a password&nbsp;app

  *Spectre* is a password calculator:

  <u title="Sarah's Twitter password!">`Reka3$PofyPemi`</u>  
  You remember one secret, let math do the rest.
  
  Cryptographic passwords are never unavailable,  
  lost, ransomed, confiscated or stolen.

  We delete our passwords.
