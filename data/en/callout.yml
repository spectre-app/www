### CALLOUT
enable: true
name: Introduction

callout: |
  Your entire online personhood,  
  gated behind a wall of passwords,  
  trapped in a vault  
  owned and controlled  
  by remote cloud operators.

  Disaster is just *that* day away.  
  We delete our passwords.

  *Spectre* is a completely novel approach to digital access control.
  
  Rather than trying to keep countless passwords safe in an app, keychain or browser,  
  *Spectre* holds <u>no passwords</u> at all.  
  
  When it's time to log in, *Spectre* calculates your site's password for you onâ€‘demand,  
  storing it nowhere, ensuring it can never be unavailable, lost, or stolen.
  
  Is that even possible?  
  It is now.
